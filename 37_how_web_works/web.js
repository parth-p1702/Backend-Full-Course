// 1. Request and response life cycle:-
// Browser → DNS → Server → Processing (code + database) → Response → Browser renders page.

// 2.HTTP and HTTPS:-
// HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication on the web.
// HTTPS (HTTP Secure) is the secure version of HTTP, using encryption (SSL/TLS) to protect data.
// Both protocols enable the transfer of data between clients and servers, but HTTPS adds a layer of security to protect sensitive information.
// HTTPS provides different methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
