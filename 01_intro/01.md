# Introduction to Node.js

## What is Node.js?
Node.js is an **open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment** that allows you to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser.  
- Created by **Ryan Dahl** in **2009**  
- Built on **Google Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine**  

---

## 2. Open Source
- Node.js is **open source** → source code is freely available to use, modify, and contribute.  
- Huge **community support** and an ecosystem of libraries via **npm (Node Package Manager)**.

---

## 3. Cross Platform
- Runs on **Windows, Linux, macOS, Unix**, etc.  
- Highly adaptable across different systems.

---

## 4. JavaScript Runtime Environment
- Traditionally, JavaScript only ran in browsers.  
- Node.js provides a **runtime outside the browser**, enabling server-side development.  
- Executes JavaScript directly on the server using the **V8 engine**.  

---

## 5. With Node.js You Can
- Build **backend servers** and **REST APIs**  
- Develop **real-time applications** (e.g. chat apps, gaming servers)  
- Create **single-page applications (SPAs)** with frontend frameworks  
- Work with databases like **MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL**  
- Build **desktop apps** (via Electron) and **mobile apps** (via React Native)  

---

## 6. Why is Node.js Special as a Runtime?
- **Event-driven, non-blocking I/O model** → handles multiple requests efficiently.  
- **Asynchronous programming** → improves speed and scalability.  
- **Single-threaded but highly efficient** → manages thousands of concurrent connections.  
- Makes **JavaScript a full-stack language** (frontend + backend).  

---

## 7. Why Do We Need Node.js?
- Traditional backends (PHP, Java, Python) are **multi-threaded** and not ideal for real-time apps.  
- Node.js is:  
  - Lightweight  
  - Fast  
  - Scalable  
- Perfect for:  
  - **APIs**  
  - **Microservices**  
  - **Real-time applications**  
- Allows developers to use **JavaScript for both frontend & backend** → saves time and boosts productivity.  

---

## 8. Where is Node.js Used?
- **Web Servers & APIs** → RESTful APIs, GraphQL  
- **Real-Time Applications** → chat apps (WhatsApp, Slack), live streaming  
- **IoT Applications** → devices and sensors control  
- **Microservices Architecture** → breaking apps into smaller services  
- **Companies using Node.js**: Netflix, LinkedIn, PayPal, Uber, eBay, Walmart
