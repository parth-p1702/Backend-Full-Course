// It allows developers to build scalable network applications using JavaScript on the server side.
// Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient.
// This makes it ideal for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.
// Node.js has a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, making it a popular choice for web development.
// Some popular frameworks built on Node.js include Express.js, Koa.js, and Nest.js.
// These frameworks provide developers with tools and features to build robust web applications quickly and efficiently.
