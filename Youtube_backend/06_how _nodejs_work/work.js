// How nodejs Work:-
// Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
// It allows developers to run JavaScript on the server side.
// Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient.
// It is designed to build scalable network applications.
// Node.js has a single-threaded model with event looping.
// This allows it to handle many connections simultaneously.
// It uses callbacks and promises to manage asynchronous operations.
// Node.js has a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, making it suitable for various applications.
// Developers can create web servers, APIs, and real-time applications using Node.js.
